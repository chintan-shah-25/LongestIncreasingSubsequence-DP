LongestIncreasingSubsequence-DP
===============================

In the longest increasing subsequence problem, the input is a sequence of numbers a1; : : : ; an.
A subsequence is any subset of these numbers taken in order, of the form ai1 ; ai2 ; : : : ; aik where
1  i1 < i2 <    < ik  n, and an increasing subsequence is one in which the numbers are
getting strictly larger. The task is to nd the increasing subsequence of greatest length. For
instance, the longest increasing subsequence of 5 2 8 6 3 6 9 7 is 2 3 6 9

Explanation is great. Please see the java file for my implementation.
